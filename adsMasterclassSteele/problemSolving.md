# Problem Solving

### Understand the Problem
1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution?
4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs?
5. How should I label the important data needed to solve the problem?

### Explore Examples
1. Start with simple examples: sanity check
2. Explore more complex examples
3. Cover cases of empty or null inputs
4. Explore some invalid inputs

### Break the Problem Down
1. Explicitly write out the steps you need to take

### Solve or Simplify
1. Solve the problem.
2. If you can't solve it, solve a simpler problem.
    - Find the core difficulty
    - Temporarily ignore that so you'll have something to show for yourself
    - Write the solution to the simplified problem
    - Expand the solution to cover the more difficult problem.

### Look Back and Refactor
1. Can you check the result?
2. Can you solve this differently?
3. Can your solution be understood at a glance?
4. Can you reuse your solution for a different problem?
5. Can you improve the performance of your solution?
6. Can you think of other ways to refactor?
7. How did other people solve this problem?
